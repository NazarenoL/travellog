title: Japan
description: >-
  It is no surprise for anyone that knows me, that Japan has a special place in
  my mind.


  A lot of people has found their safe place where everything feels comfortable and just right (A house, a mountain, someone's hug). For me, my safe place is not comfort, is the excitement of feeling uncomfortably nice. Japan is my escape pod from normality, where everything feels different. Where the rhythm of life is written in a notation that I can't understand.


  I have not felt at ease for a single minute in my two trips to Japan, but I have never been so thrilled. **Japan is crazy, but a crazy that keeps me excited like no other place.**
