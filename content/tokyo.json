  "description": "It is no surprise for anyone that knows me, that Japan has a special place in my mind.\n\nA lot of people has found their safe place where everything feels comfortable and _just right_ (A house, a mountain, someone's hug). For me, my safe place is not comfort, is the excitement of feeling uncomfortably nice. Japan is my escape pod from normality, where everything feels different. Where the rhythm of life is written in a notation that I can't understand.\n\nI have not felt at ease for a single minute in my two trips to Japan, but I have never been so thrilled. **Japan is crazy, but a crazy that keeps me excited like no other place.**",

Most of them, tiny bars sitting 4-6 persons max.Â Although in Shinjuki, and right next to the neon-y Kabukicho, it is a peek into a more traditional style of japanese nightlife.\n\n With most bars being slightly bigger than your average bathroom, conversations with your neighbors are guaranteed (Specially afther the third shot of sake).",
